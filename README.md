# bpc-sdk-unofficial

Virtimo :tm: BPC :tm: Modules are special ExtJS :tm: packages, distributed as osgi ready Java :tm: web archives. 

We built a modern NodeJS only toolkit for that purpose.

We try to keep dependencies as limited as possible. 

## Features

* build / create modules
* build settings using js - default role handling
* transform legacy (grouped as of now) settings into sorted settings
* release handling
* cli


* you do not need ExtJS during build time
* fast and easy setup - basically install & lets go

## Requirements

* npm, nodejs

## Install

* npm i @srcld/bpc-sdk-unofficial --save-dev

## Feedback wanted

* feel free to create an issue here
